Welcome Back.

We will develop a test data producer for our project in this lecture.

So, let's start.

Go to the development environment.

Go to Workspace, Repos and choose your SBIT repository.

Now, you can add a new notebook here.

Rename the notebook. 

We are now ready to code.

Let me import the config notebook.

I will paste the code for the producer class in the next cell.

Here it is.

Let me quickly walk you through the code.

The __init__ method is the constructor, and we define some variables in this method.

Then, I defined five methods to produce five data sets.

The user_registration() method produces the user registration data set to the landing zone.

This method takes the set number as input.

So, we pass 1 to produce the first payload and 2 to produce the second payload.

The test data is already available in the ADLS test data directory.

The function will simply copy it from the test data directory and paste it to the appropriate landing zone directory.

Once the payload is available in the landing zone, our jobs can read it from there.

And I am taking the same approach to produce all the five data sets.

The profile_cdc method is to produce the user profile events.

Similarly, the workout, bpm, and gym_logins produce the other three sets.

Finally, I have a common produce() method to call all five producers.

Then, I have two validation methods to verify if the input data is produced correctly.

And that is all.

The code is straightforward, and I hope you can understand it.

That's all for this lecture.

See you again in the following lecture.

Keep Learning and Keep growing.
